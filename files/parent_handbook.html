        Parent-Staff Communication
      </h1>
      <p>
        Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails
        give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or
        emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations and/or
        concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email
        or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences
      </h2>
      <p>
        Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play,
        conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers
        9
        keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their
        development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s
        writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities
        in their program to enhance needed skills for children.
        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an
        informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a
        more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any
        time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers
      </p>
