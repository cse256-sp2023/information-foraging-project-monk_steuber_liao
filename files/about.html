                        The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a
                        cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St.
                        Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the
                        highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7
                        months to 5 years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children
                        are from families of Washington University in St. Louis faculty,
                        staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the
                        community.

                        National Association for the Education of Young Children, by
                        which&nbsp;it&nbsp;is accredited. It is licensed by the State of

                        The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child
                        development and early childhood teacher training. Washington
                        University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to
                        assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the
                        nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student workers’
                        presence enables children to receive additional individual
                        attention.

                        The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus.
                        It is composed of three classrooms which are designed to offer
                        children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional
                        all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of
                        indoor gross motor play materials.&nbsp;A large outdoor play area
                        gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide
                        and play in the sand.

                        We’ve seen definite growth in our child’s social-emotional
                        skills, and we appreciate that the teachers encourage
                        independence and resolution of conflict between the children
                        to allow them to get comfortable using these skills.

                        The program has brought a structure and discipline and
                        prepared my (child) well for kindergarten this year. I was
                        amazed how the teachers cleverly integrated a variety of
                        science/math/art/craft concepts into the curriculum so well.

                        The indoor and outdoor play areas are very nice, but what
                        makes the school so special are the teachers and the caring,
                        cooperative, loving atmosphere they foster among the students
                        and throughout the classroom activities.

                        Those stick with (my child) and provide a wonderful learning
                        opportunity and change of scenery.

                        She felt completely comfortable with other children and gained
                        confidence for herself. I believe that she knows how much she
                        is loved by teachers and children.

                        My child almost always gets back in the car happy (and often
                        times worn out!) about her full morning. She adores her
                        teachers and has made friends. I like that there is a free
                        choice environment while still maintaining routine/structure.
                        She also seems to particularly enjoy art class!

                        taking care of their space. The outdoor amenities are safe and
                        messy and fun and just right for Pre-K.
