            The indoor and outdoor play areas are very nice, but what
            makes the school so special are the teachers and the caring,
            cooperative, loving atmosphere they foster among the students
            and throughout the classroom activities.

            I particularly like the walks the class takes around campus.
            Those stick with (my child) and provide a wonderful learning
            opportunity and change of scenery.

            We really appreciated the consistent diversity of activities.
            Our (child) started off gravitating towards particular things,
            but by the end of the year had started to engage more in
            activities our (child) used to shy away from.

            We’ve seen definite growth in our child’s social-emotional
            skills, and we appreciate that the teachers encourage
            independence and resolution of conflict between the children
            to allow them to get comfortable using these skills.

            (WUNS) is a safe and wonderful place that fosters growth in a
            play-based (as it should be!) program.
