      <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
      <p>

        philosophy and educational practices may be found in the

      <h2>Social/Emotional Development</h2>
      <p>Individual children’s capabilities are valued and strengthened within a group setting throughout the curriculum.</p>
      <h2>Intellectual Development</h2>
      <p>Various appropriate learning methods for each child are used to carefully develop knowledge in areas such as <b>Language</b>, <b>Math</b>, <b>Science</b>, and <b>Social Studies</b>. </p>
      <h2>Physical Development</h2>
      <p>Focusing on <b>Gross motor</b> and <b>Fine motor</b> skills, many opportunities are provided to develop children’s physical skills. 
      </p>
      <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
      <p>With emphasis on the process of exploration, children get time, space and freedom to exercise their creative skills
      </p>

      <h2>Discipline</h2>
      <p>The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. </p>
      <p>Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Positive reinforcement</li>
          <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction</li>
          <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities</li>
          <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings</li>
          <li>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner</li>
          <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. To learn more about the school’s approach to discipline, please take a look at the <a class="download" href="downloads/parent_handbook.pdf">parent handbook</a> in the Parent Handbook tab

      <h2>Extra Help</h2>
      <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
of ways, which may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
        <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
        <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
        <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
        <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
        <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
      </ul>
